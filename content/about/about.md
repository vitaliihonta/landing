*Words kill, words give life; they’re either **poison** or fruit—you choose.*

*--- Proverbs 18:21*

*Poison* is a **clean**, **professional** Hugo theme designed to **captivate** your readers.

It's also **tiny** and **privacy conscious** with *no external dependencies*.  That's right---no JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts.  No ads or trackers polluting your console window (try it out and take a look).  **We kept things simple**.  A little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo.

All of the static assets for the site (JS files, CSS, and fonts) are located within the theme's */static/* directory.  **That way you know *exactly* what's going on your site**.

To get started, I recommend reading through my introductory post [here]({{< ref "/posts/introducing-poison.md" >}}).  I use this theme on my personal site at https://lukeorth.com, so check it out if you want to see *Poison* in action.
