Hello there, my name is Vitalii ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m passionate about software engineering (especially Scala, but also like Python).

The things I feel the most interested in are Functional Programming,
Data Engineering, Distributed Systems in general, Workflow Management Systems, etc.

I believe software engineering (and functional programming in particular) should be:
- **Principled** but **practical**
- **Pragmatic** enough but still **enjoyable**
- **Inclusive** and **welcoming** for newcomers!

Following these credos, I authored some open source projects:
- **[ZIO Temporal](https://zio-temporal.vhonta.dev/)**
- **[Scala QL](https://scala-ql.vhonta.dev/)**
- ...and more.  

This is my personal blog.  
Also, sometimes I give talks at software engineering conferences, and they will be posted here ðŸ™‚
